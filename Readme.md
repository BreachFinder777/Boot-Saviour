## ü§î What is GRUB and Why Does it Break?

### What is GRUB?
**GRUB** (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the program that starts your Linux system when you turn on your computer. It's like the "ignition system" of your computer.

### Why Does GRUB Break?
GRUB commonly breaks due to:
- **Windows updates** (especially on dual-boot systems)
- **Linux kernel updates**
- **Disk errors or power failures**
- **Partition changes or resizing**
- **Improper system shutdowns**

### What Happens When GRUB Breaks?
When GRUB breaks, you see scary messages like:
- `GRUB rescue>`
- `No bootable device found`
- `Operating System not found`
- Computer boots to a black screen

**Don't panic!** This tool fixes all these problems automatically.

## üö® Emergency Recovery

### If Your Computer Won't Boot

#### Method 1: Live USB/DVD
1. **Boot from a Ubuntu/Linux Mint live USB**
2. **Open Terminal** (Ctrl+Alt+T)
3. **Connect to internet** (if needed)
4. **Run these commands:**
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update

# Download the recovery tool
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/grub-auto-recovery.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x grub-auto-recovery.sh

# Run emergency repair
sudo ./grub-auto-recovery.sh --force-repair
```

#### Method 2: GRUB Rescue Prompt
If you see `grub rescue>`:
1. **Don't panic!** This is fixable
2. **Boot from live USB** (method 1 above)
3. **Run the emergency repair**

#### Method 3: Windows Overwrote GRUB
This commonly happens after Windows updates:
1. **Boot from live USB**
2. **Run the tool with force repair:**
```bash
sudo ./grub-auto-recovery.sh --force-repair
```
3. **Reboot** - your Linux system should be accessible again

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "This script must be run as root"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Always use sudo
sudo grub-auto-recovery.sh --status
```

#### Issue: "Could not detect root partition"
**Cause:** Your system has an unusual partition setup
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check your partitions
lsblk

# Look for your root partition (usually mounted at /)
# Then specify it manually in config
sudo grub-auto-recovery.sh --config

# Add this line with your root partition:
CUSTOM_ROOT_PARTITION="/dev/sda1"  # Replace with your partition
```

#### Issue: "GRUB repair failed in chroot"
**Cause:** Filesystem corruption or unusual system setup
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check filesystem
sudo fsck /dev/sda1  # Replace with your root partition

# Try interactive mode for more details
sudo grub-auto-recovery.sh --interactive
```

#### Issue: "Failed to mount EFI partition"
**Cause:** UEFI system with missing/corrupted EFI partition
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if EFI partition exists
sudo fdisk -l | grep EFI

# If missing, you may need to recreate it (advanced)
# Boot from live USB and run the tool
```

### Getting Help
